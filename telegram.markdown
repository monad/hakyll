FAQ
===

What is this?
-------------
A ~~Telegram group~~ secret society of programmers. 

Why was I added?
----------------

We have a piece of AI software called `wal ter' that deterministically locates and adds new programmers. Most likely you have a username related to programming.

What should we talk about?
--------------------------

Anything related to programming is fine! Though likewise, anything else is okay too but don't overdo it.

Can I leave?
------------

If you'd like, though The Wired is vast, and it's possible you could end up in another plane of it.

I need something to do!

RESOURCE LIST
=============

This is a list of the best programming resources on the web, put together by people with too much time on their hands.

##Online Compilers/IDEs
* [Ideone](http://ideone.com/) Allows you to run, compile and share code in many languages.
* [repl.it](https://repl.it/) Interactive read-eval-print loops for mostly functional languages. Sparse features, but allows sharing and playback.
* [Runnable](http://code.runnable.com/) Allows you to create an anonymous GNU/Linux sandbox with full root access and install whatever you'd like. These can then be shared with others. Amazing service.
* [Koding](https://koding.com/) Similar to Runnable, but requires login and your VM is saved. Just like having a virtual machine in the browser. Allows SSH access. Full root access.
* [PasteRack](http://pasterack.org/) Specifically for Racket, even works with graphical programs.
* [lpaste](http://lpaste.net/) Lightweight pastebin designed for Haskell but supports many languages.
* [FPComplete](https://www.fpcomplete.com/) Complete learning center for Haskell, just... wow.
* [Godbolt](https://gcc.godbolt.org/) Shows the assembly output of many C compilers for a given program. Handy for debugging and optimization.

##Learning Resources/Books
* [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) Details solutions for many problems in many languages. Good to consult for reference when working with an unfamiliar language.
* [Free programming books](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md) A large list of many free programming books.
* [C Programming](http://www.cprogramming.com/) I learned C from this and K&R many years ago. Recommend it I guess.
* [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/) The definitive reference for C++.
* [Hoogle](http://hoogle.haskell.org/) Haskell API search engine!
* [HTDP](http://www.htdp.org/) Classic book for learning about program architecture.
* [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-5.html) The full text of Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, free to read online! One of the best books for learning how to program.
* [K&R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) The definitive introduction to one of the most widely used languages in the world. A good introduction to programming.
* [TC++PL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C%2B%2B_Programming_Language) A comprehensive overview of C++ by its creator.

##Text Editors
* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) Emacs is probably the most flexible editor in the world.
* [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) Classic UNIX text editor, improved.
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) The next generation of text editors, inspired by Sublime Text and built by Github. Be sure to disable metrics.
* [Geany](http://www.geany.org/) Lightweight GTK text editor with a good amount of features. Has poor support for adding new languages.

##Source code hosting
* [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in) Has free private repositories.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) Used by everyone. No private repositories without paying.
* Or roll your own, which is very easy.

##Utilities
* [Asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) Record and share your terminal session!

##Fonts
* [Codeface](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/codeface) Collection of great programming fonts.
* [Tewi](https://github.com/lucy/tewi-font) Great bitmap font with a lot of unicode support.
